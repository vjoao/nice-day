## NiceDay
A Vue.js powered application to check if the weather is nice on your location
It uses a free version of the DarkSky API (forecast.io) that is behind a proxy because DarkSky disabled CORS.

The application supports persisted settings through `vuex-persistedstate`.
Try not to abuse the API calls for Google geocoding / maps. There are no API Keys on this repository, feel free to add yours if needed. You can also change the proxy URL on `/services/constants.js`.
